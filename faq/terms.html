                                Bonus programs are intended for recreational players only. Any

                                bonuses revoked and be subject to further sanctions. Bonus abuse may be
                                defined as (but not restricted to) clients cashing out for the purpose
                                of re-depositing, or referring new Player Accounts that they are using
                                themselves. Sanctions may be in the form of increased rollover
                                requirements or loss of bonus privileges altogether for the offending
                                Player Account as well as any linked Player Accounts. FB88.com reserves
